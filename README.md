# introductory_cpp_programs
This repository contains 11 C++ projects using concepts such as classes, pointers, memory management, lambda functions, and initializer lists. The projects in this file are as follows:

•	image_convolution:
  Struct to blur, emboss, sharpen, and give edge detection to an image (in the form of a matrix with the dimensions specified in the file) using the convolve function. Can also embed an mask into an image. Includes read and write image functions. Uses the split functions to gather a series of ints from an input text file.
  
•	fun_with_strings:
  This code decodes a secret message based on an arbitrary set of rules. I am saving this code for future reference for how to manipulate strings.

•	word_processing_and_jaccard_similarity:
  Functions for determining the similarity in two texts by calculating the jaccard similarity and cosine similarity. Functions used for this include a splitting function, word cleaning function, printing function, and norm factor calculating function.

•	number_string_tester:
  Determines whether an input string can be cast as a binary, hex, octal, int, float, or none of the above. Prints either the name of what the string can be cast to or "false."

•	anchilles_number_tester:
  Prints whether an input number is prime, powerful, a perfect prime, or an Achilles number. Input the number, and then the program prints four bools depending on whether it is prime, powerful, a perfect prime, or an Achilles number, respectively.
  
•	MVM_Class

•	MVM_Class_V2

•	Multiple_Linked_Element_Class

•	variable_sequence_analysis:
  This program finds the longest sequence generated for every number between two input numbers (and including the first input number). The sequence is determined by taking the square root of the term if it is even and multiplying the term to the power of 3/2 if the term is odd. The sequence ends when the term becomes less than or equal to zero. Program prints the longest sequence length with the corresponding starting number and the largest term generated in all of the sequences with the corresponding start number.

•	hello_world_c-:
  An introductory C++ hello world program.
  
  ***I wrote these programs a long time ago and I can't find the header files for a couple of them. I also cannot find the exact prompts. I created these programs for a CS class taught by Bill Punch.
